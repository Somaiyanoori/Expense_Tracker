# Expense_Tracker

Expense Tracker is a simple React application built to practice core React concepts such as state management, component composition, derived state, and list rendering. Users can add, filter, and delete expenses while viewing total spending and category-based summaries in real time. This project focuses on clean UI, reusable components, and practical React patterns.
